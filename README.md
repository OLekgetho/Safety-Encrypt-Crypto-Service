# Safety Encrypt Crypto Service

This is the backend cryptographic microservice for the **Safety Encrypt** mobile app.

**Safety Encrypt** is a mobile application focused on security and privacy.  
It lets users easily:

- Encode and decode text (Base64, URL encoding, etc.)
- Encrypt and decrypt messages (using strong encryption)
- BruteForce hashed Password
- Hash passwords securely
- Generate strong, random passwords

This Crypto Service handles the more advanced or sensitive cryptographic operations on the server side.  
It keeps things consistent, secure, and updatable — while the mobile app takes care of the user interface and everyday features.

The full system will use multiple microservices (auth, gateway, crypto, etc.) for better scalability and security.

**Current status:** Early development – core crypto functions being built.

More detailed documentation coming when the app and services are complete.
